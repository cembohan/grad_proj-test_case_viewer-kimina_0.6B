Let's do this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we need to isolate x. We can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation to get:\n3x = 29 - 2\n\nThen, we need to divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\nx = (29 - 2) / 3\n\nLet's compute (29 - 2) / 3:\n29 - 2 = 27\nSo, x = 27 / 3\n\n27 divided by 3 is 9.\n\nTherefore, x = 9.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:\n\n```tactics\nimport Mathlib\n\ntheorem even_square_implies_even (n : ℤ) : Even (n ^ 2) → Even n := by\n```\n\nWait, no, that's not the theorem we need to prove. The theorem is about proving that if n^2 is even, then n is even. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem is to prove that if 3x + 2 = 29 for a real number x, then x must be 9. But the formal statement here is about proving that if n^2 is even, then n is even. Let me check.\n\nWait, the theorem is `even_square_implies_even (n : ℤ) : Even (n ^ 2) → Even n`. So given that n^2 is even, prove that n is even. But how does that relate to the equation 3x + 2 = 29?\n\nWait, perhaps the theorem is a general statement about evenness of n given that n^2 is even. Let me think.\n\nTo prove that n is even given that n^2 is even. Let's think about the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\nIf n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2, which is even. So that works.\n\nIf n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. So if n^2 is even, then n must be even.\n\nSo the theorem is true. Let me try to prove it in Lean.\n\n```tactics\nimport Mathlib\n\ntheorem even_square_implies_even (n : ℤ) : Even (n ^ 2) → Even n := by\n```\n\nSo we need to prove that if n^2 is even, then n is even. Let's introduce the hypothesis.\n\n```tactics\nintro h\n```\n\nNow we need to prove that n is even. Let's think about how to prove this.\n\nIf n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. But we have n^2 is even, so n must be even.\n\nSo we need to show that n is even. Let's use the definition of even.\n\n```tactics\nhave h1 : n % 2 = 0 ∨ n % 2 = 1 := by omega\n```\n\nSo n is either even or odd. Let's consider both cases.\n\n```tactics\nrcases h1 with (h1 | h1)\n```\n\nCase 1: n is even. Then n % 2 = 0, which means n is even. So we can conclude that n is even.\n\n```tactics\n· -- n is even\n  have : Even n := by\n    refine' ⟨n / 2, by omega⟩\n  exact this\n```\n\nCase 2: n is odd. Then n % 2 = 1. Let's show that this leads to a contradiction with the fact that n^2 is even.\n\nIf n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. But we have n^2 is even, so this is a contradiction.\n\nLet's formalize this in Lean.\n\n```tactics\n· -- n is odd\n  have h2 : (n : ℤ) % 2 = 1 := by omega\n```\n\nNow, we need to show that if n is odd, then n^2 is odd, which contradicts the hypothesis that n^2 is even.\n\n```tactics\nhave h3 : (n ^ 2 : ℤ) % 2 = 1 := by\n  have h4 : n % 2 = 1 := h2\n  simp [pow_two, Int.add_emod, Int.mul_emod, h4]\n```\n\nSo n^2 is odd, which means n^2 % 2 = 1. But we have that n^2 is even, so n^2 % 2 = 0. This is a contradiction.\n\n```tactics\nhave h4 : (n ^ 2 : ℤ) % 2 = 0 := by\n  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := h\n  omega\n```\n\nNow we have that n^2 % 2 = 1 and n^2 % 2 = 0, which is a contradiction.\n\n```tactics\nomega\n```\n\nSo this completes the proof. Therefore, if n^2 is even, then n must be even.\n\nThe theorem is proven. Therefore, if 3x + 2 = 29 for a real number x, then x must be 9. Wait, no, that's not the theorem. The theorem is about proving that if n^2 is even, then n is even. So the given theorem is correct, and we have proven it.\n\nSo the answer is that if n^2 is even, then n must be even. So x must be 9.

Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what it means for n^2 to be even. A number is even if it's divisible by 2. So n^2 ≡ 0 (mod 2). \n\nIf n is odd, then n ≡ 1 (mod 2). Let's compute n^2 in mod 2. If n ≡ 1 (mod 2), then n^2 ≡ 1^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2). \n\nSo if n^2 ≡ 0 (mod 2), then n^2 ≡ 0 (mod 2) implies that n^2 is even. But if n is odd, then n^2 is odd. So n must be even.\n\nSo we need to show that if n^2 is even, then n is even. Let's proceed with the proof.\n\n```tactics\nintro h\n```\n\nNow we need to prove that n is even given that n^2 is even. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nIf n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k, so n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2, which is even. \n\nIf n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k, so n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. \n\nSo if n^2 is even, then n must be even. Let's prove this in Lean.\n\n```tactics\nhave h1 : n % 2 = 0 ∨ n % 2 = 1 := by\n  omega\n```\n\nSo n is either even or odd. Let's consider both cases.\n\nIf n is even, then n % 2 = 0, which means n is even. \n\nIf n is odd, then n % 2 = 1, which means n^2 % 2 = 1. But since n^2 is even, n^2 % 2 = 0. This is a contradiction. \n\nSo we need to show that n % 2 = 0.\n\n```tactics\nrcases h1 with (h1 | h1)\n```\n\nCase 1: n % 2 = 0, which means n is even. \n\n```tactics\n· -- n is even\n  have h2 : Even n := by\n    refine' ⟨n / 2, by omega⟩\n  exact h2\n```\n\nCase 2: n % 2 = 1, which means n is odd. \n\nLet's show that this leads to a contradiction. If n is odd, then n^2 is odd.

So given that n^2 is even, prove that n is even. But how does that relate to the equation 3x + 2 = 29?\n\nWait, maybe the theorem is a bit different. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: Let n be an integer. If n^2 is even, then n is even. So the theorem is correct. Let me see how to prove it.\n\nSo we need to prove that if n^2 is even, then n is even. Let's think about how to prove this.\n\nIf n^2 is even, then n^2 = 2k for some integer k. We need to show that n is even, i.e., n = 2m for some integer m.\n\nSo n^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2. So n^2 = 4m^2. But n^2 = 2k, so 4m^2 = 2k. Simplify: 2m^2 = k. So k is even, so 2m^2 is even. But n^2 = 2k, so n^2 is even. So that's consistent.\n\nBut how does that help us show that n is even? Let's think.\n\nIf n is odd, then n = 2m + 1 for some integer m. Then n^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1. So n^2 is odd. But we have that n^2 is even. So n^2 = 2k. So 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 2k. But 4m^2 + 4m + 1 is odd, so 2k is odd. But 2k is even. Contradiction. So n cannot be odd. Therefore n must be even.\n\nSo this is how we can prove it.

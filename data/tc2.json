Let's think about this mathematically first.\n\nIf $n^2$ is even, then $n^2 = 2k$ for some integer $k$. We need to show that $n$ is even. \n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$. Let's compute $n^2$ in this case:\n\n$n^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 = 4(m^2 + m) + 1$\n\nSo $n^2$ is odd, because it equals $4(m^2 + m) + 1$, which is $1$ more than a multiple of $4$. \n\nBut we are given that $n^2$ is even. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $n$ cannot be odd, so $n$ must be even.\n\nNow, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:\n\n```tactics\nimport Mathlib\n\ntheorem even_square_implies_even (n : ℤ) : Even (n ^ 2) → Even n := by\n```\n\nWe need to prove that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

Let's think about how to prove this.\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$. Let's compute $n^2$:\n\n$n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1$\n\nSo $n^2$ is odd, because it equals $4(k^2 + k) + 1$, which is $1$ more than a multiple of $4$. \n\nBut we are given that $n^2$ is even. This is a contradiction. Therefore, $n$ cannot be odd, so $n$ must be even.\n\nTo prove this in Lean, we need to show that $n$ is even. Let's use the definition of even:\n\n```tactics\nhave h1 : n % 2 = 0 ∨ n % 2 = 1 := by\n  omega\n```\n\nNow we need to analyze both cases. If $n$ is even, then $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, and $n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which is consistent. If $n$ is odd, then $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, and $n^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which contradicts the fact that $n^2$ is even.\n\nLet's continue with the case analysis:\n\n```tactics\nrcases h1 with (h1 | h1)\n```\n\nCase 1: $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$\n\nIf $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, then $n^2 \\equiv 0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, which is consistent with the fact that $n^2$ is even.
